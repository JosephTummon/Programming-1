The recursive stops working after x >= 998. It says recursion exceeded in comparison.
They non-recursive was much faster for smaller numbers, but slower for bigger
The non-recursive version could handle much larger numbers.\

For example when i enetered 6, i got times 0.055 for non-recursive
and 0.0189 for recursive.

For bigger numbers, like when i entered 100, i got 0.09 for my non-recursive 
and I got 0.47 for my recursive
